<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello there, I'm Harvey and I like to think of myself as a "jack of all
  trades" in the business world. As the co-founder and COO of a startup, I've
  worn many hats and have become a master of juggling multiple responsibilities
  with ease. From IT management to international relations and everything in
  between, I've conquered it all.
</p>

<p>
  But my thirst for knowledge and growth never stops, which is why I'm currently
  on a mission to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I see it as the cherry on
  top of my already impressive business sundae. With the ability to code and
  create stunning websites, I'll be like a superhero with a cape made of code.
  I'm a firm believer that one can never have too many skills, and I'm
  determined to add this one to my arsenal.
</p>

<p>
  So here I am, ready to take on this challenge and become a master of all
  things web development. With my determination and a sprinkle of humor, I'm
  confident that I'll succeed in this exciting and ever-evolving field.
